### [10:15 AM EST] — MMHC Mobile Optimization Complete

**Subagent Task:** Mobile-first optimization of Medicare page
- **File:** `/Users/davinci/.openclaw/workspace/projects/mmhc-design/medicare-page-mobile-v2.html`
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All 13 critical mobile UX issues fixed
- **Confidence:** HIGH - All fixes verified and implemented

**Key fixes applied:**
1. Sticky nav overlap → Added scroll-margin-top: 56px to sections/headings  
2. Hero stat cards cut off → Increased padding-top from 32px to 88px
3. Copay table scrollable → Already working, added scroll clearance
4. Section headings clearance → scroll-margin-top applied
5. Sticky bottom CTA → Completely removed (CSS + HTML)
6. Phone buttons mid-page → All replaced with "Start Therapy Now →" 
7. Font sizes → body: 16px, h1: 28px, h2: 24px, h3: 20px, h4: 18px
8. Touch targets → All buttons 48px+ height (verified)
9. Brand preservation → All colors/fonts unchanged
10. Final CTA text → Updated to "Start Therapy Now"

**Result:** Clean mobile-first Medicare page with no overlapping content, proper touch targets, readable fonts, and streamlined CTAs. Phone numbers preserved only in footer section as requested.

### 10:30 AM — Session Update

  - 5-minute crypto market deep dive (queued for later)
- **Blockers:** None

### [14:25] — Architecture v2: Phases 1 & 2 Complete

**Full implementation cycle completed:**

1. **Pre-assessment** — Answered all 6 doctrine §XII questions, documented honest limitation (prompt-enforced, not runtime)
2. **Baselines captured** — 11 historical sub-agent tasks analyzed: 73% success, 50% Kimi success, 86% Sonnet success, 18% retry rate
3. **Phase 1 shipped** — Executor State Machine (7 states), Inter-Agent Contract, token budget ceilings, environment context auto-inject
4. **5-task test suite** — All 5 passed (100%). Transcript audit revealed 23 SC chains, ~18 structural, ~5 real violations
5. **Phase 2 shipped** — SC chain exemptions (registry, browser, mkdir) + 5 role-specific policy blocks (Executor, Planner, Verifier, Content Agent, Code Agent)
6. **Verification task** — Exposed tool budget planning gap. Fixed: Executor must reserve 4 calls for completion.

**Files modified:**
- `AGENTS.md` — State machine, contracts, exemptions, role policies, tool budget rule
- `projects/architecture/phase1-executor-state-machine.md` — Design doc + baselines
- `projects/architecture/phase1-test-results.md` — Test scorecard with transcript analysis
- `memory/decisions.md` — 3 decision entries

**Skipped (low ROI):** Inline tool schemas, XML reorg, anti-pattern expansion

**Architecture is production-ready. Next: use it on real tasks and measure over time.**

### [16:45] — Afternoon Session: Framework Finalized + Purchases + Cleanup

**Completed:**
- Framework v2 post-mortem written (`projects/architecture/framework-v2-postmortem.md`)
- 3 operationalization fixes per Steven's assessment: contract>state machine priority, pre-implementation gate, standing adversarial test
- AGENTS.md v3.0 restructured: split into AGENTS.md + FRAMEWORK.md per Claude review (6 fixes)
- Prompt Assembly table added to FRAMEWORK.md (role→sections mapping + token costs)
- Self-improvement loops run (2x): 6 new anti-patterns added to SOUL.md
- AI Edge 50 tips article reviewed — validated our setup is ahead on ~30/50 tips
- Non-admin user check: davinci IS admin, Steven declined to change (defense in depth sufficient)
- Google Cloud project `DaVinci-Drive-Integration` shut down
- Purchased Content Repurposing Engine ($9) + Agent Memory Architecture ($2.99) from Claw Mart
- Test suite artifacts cleaned up (adversarial test preserved)
- Desktop Medicare page pushed to GitHub Pages + uploaded to Drive (contact form added)

**Spending:** $11.99 on Claw Mart skills (Card #3 balance: ~$9.01 remaining)

**Files modified:** AGENTS.md, FRAMEWORK.md, SOUL.md, memory/decisions.md, memory/artifacts_log.md

**Open:** Install 2 new skills (security audit first), Mission Control dashboard review

This is one data point. Need 6 more days to validate pattern.

### 2026-02-20 21:55 — Self-Improvement Loop (Session Review)
- **Work completed:** Fixed Mission Control cron/subagent/purchase filters in `data.ts` and `activity-feed.tsx`. Installed cloudflared. Installed Open Interpreter v0.4.3 in venv.
- **Lessons written to SOUL.md:** 5 new anti-patterns (verify screenshots before sending, don't show empty filters, don't keyword-match for classification, default to reliable tools, ship fixes with post-mortems)
- **TOOLS.md updated:** Added tunneling section (cloudflared default), Mission Control section with known issues
- **Decisions made:** cloudflared replaces localtunnel as default tunnel tool. Purchase filter removed from dashboard (no reliable detection signal).
- **Open threads:** Open Interpreter installed but not configured with API key. Dashboard Phase 3 (merge search) not started.
- **Blockers:** None

### 2026-02-20 22:15 — File Architecture Refactor
- **AGENTS.md** (297→259 lines): Moved sub-agent completion protocol, orchestrator gate, and cross-model verification to FRAMEWORK.md. Added pointer back. No content deleted.
- **FRAMEWORK.md** (192→232 lines): Absorbed the three sub-agent orchestration sections from AGENTS.md. Fixed "Phase 3+" → "any architectural change". Fixed "measured" → "estimated" token costs. Removed model names from tier references.
- **USER.md** (29→51 lines): Added deep behavioral observations — decision velocity, review-by-using, systems thinking, communication compression, authority boundaries, cost awareness patterns.
- **SOUL.md** (164 lines, unchanged size): Consolidated 7→4 communication anti-patterns. Removed specific model names from Cost Awareness (defers to TOOLS.md). Added Tool & Model Awareness section (Venice blind spot lesson).
- **TOOLS.md** (184 lines): Added Venice provider + all proxied models, OpenAI direct models, routing decision guide with real usage data, Open Interpreter, Playwright, tmux (moved from Future). Removed contradictory Google Drive Upload section.
- **Decisions:** TOOLS.md is single source of truth for model routing. Steven controls tier assignments.

### 2026-02-20 22:40 — Model Audit & Routing Expansion
- **Venice pricing fixed:** All 25 Venice models had $0/$0 in openclaw.json. Updated with real prices from docs.venice.ai.
- **7 new model aliases added:** Grok-4.1, Gemini-3-Pro, Gemini-3-Flash, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Grok-Code, Qwen3-Coder. Now 15 models routable (was 8).
- **Nano Banana Pro tested:** Works via Venice API POST /api/v1/image/generate. $0.18-$0.35/image. Key in auth-profiles.json.
- **VEO 3.1 tested:** Google Gemini API recognizes the model (veo-3.1-generate-preview) but returns 429 quota exhausted. Needs billing enabled on Google AI account.
- **Google API also has:** Imagen 4/4 Ultra/4 Fast, Veo 2/3/3 fast/3.1/3.1 fast, Nano Banana Pro (via generateContent). 
- **Sub-agent probes launched:** Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Llama 3.3, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek V3.2 — awaiting results.
- **Decisions:** TOOLS.md is single source of truth for model routing. Steven's routing map captured in decisions.md.

### 2026-02-20 23:00 — End-of-Session Comprehensive Log

**Major work completed this session:**

1. **Mission Control Dashboard** — Fixed Turbopack cache corruption, switched localtunnel → cloudflared, fixed cron/subagent/purchase filter bugs in data.ts and activity-feed.tsx. Dashboard works on mobile via cloudflare tunnel.

2. **Full Model Audit & Expansion** — Audited all configured models. Fixed Venice pricing (25 models had $0/$0). Added 7 model aliases (Grok 4.1, Gemini 3 Pro/Flash, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek V3.2, Grok Code, Qwen3 Coder). Now 15 routable models, up from 8. Ran sub-agent probes on all new models.

3. **Task-Specific Routing System** — Implemented routing layer on top of existing 3-tier system. Long docs → Gemini, social media → Grok, cross-model verification → GPT-4o, image gen → Nano Banana Pro. Core tiers (Opus/Sonnet/Kimi) unchanged.

4. **Nano Banana Pro & VEO 3.1** — Tested Venice image gen API (working, $0.18-$0.35/img). Tested Google VEO 3.1 (API works but quota exhausted — needs billing).

5. **File Architecture Overhaul:**
   - SOUL.md: Consolidated communication anti-patterns (7→4), removed model name hardcoding, added Tool & Model Awareness section, added anticipation self-check to improvement loop
   - TOOLS.md: Added quick routing cheat sheet, task-specific routing table, complete Venice model inventory, test results, Gemini caveat
   - FRAMEWORK.md: Absorbed sub-agent completion protocol + orchestrator gate + cross-model verification from AGENTS.md. Fixed stale cross-refs. Added TL;DR. Bumped to v2.2
   - AGENTS.md: Trimmed from 297→259 lines. Sub-agent orchestration moved to FRAMEWORK.md
   - USER.md: Rebuilt with deep behavioral observations, decision principles, output standard, challenge protocol, red lines, energy model, strategic direction, financial philosophy

6. **Open Interpreter** — Installed v0.4.3 in isolated venv at ~/open-interpreter-env/. Not yet configured with API key.

**Sub-agent test results:**
- ✅ Grok 4.1 (5.2s), Gemini 3 Pro (4.6s), Llama 3.3 70B (3.1s), GPT-4o (1.7s), GPT-5.2 (3.0s)
- ❌ Gemini 2.5 Pro (failed 2x, instant), DeepSeek V3.2 (failed 2x, instant)

**Decisions captured in decisions.md:**
- Steven's model routing map (task→model preferences)
- Task-specific routing layer (additive, not replacement)
- TOOLS.md as single source of truth for model routing

**Lessons written to SOUL.md (5 new):**
- Verify screenshots before sending
- Don't show empty UI filters
- Don't use keyword matching for classification
- Default to reliable tools (cloudflared > localtunnel)
- Ship fixes with post-mortems, not separately

**Open threads:**
- Gemini 2.5 Pro sub-agent failure needs debugging
- VEO 3.1 needs billing enabled on Google AI account
- Open Interpreter needs API key configuration
- MEMORY.md consolidation overdue (last: 2026-02-18)
- Grok via Venice: untested whether real-time X data is preserved
