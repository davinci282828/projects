### 2026-02-21 16:00 — Major Session Update

**Work completed:**
- Updated OpenClaw from 2026.2.19-2 to 2026.2.21-2
- Ran post-update audit (changelog review, config coherence, model testing)
- Added Gemini 3.1 Pro to model config (❌ blocked by Google billing, same as 2.5 Pro)
- Tested 4 models: ✅ Gemini 3 Flash, Grok Code, Qwen3 Coder | ❌ Gemini 3.1 Pro
- Set up fallback chain: Opus → Sonnet → GPT-4o
- Removed DeepSeek V3.2 (unreliable, failed 2x)
- Set Telegram defaultTo for cron delivery reliability
- Configured Docker sandbox for sub-agents (mode: non-main, workspace: rw, network: none)
- Created API key audit script (scripts/api-key-audit.sh)
- Added OpenAI key to Keychain (was missing)
- Updated daily security cron to include API key audit + version check
- Created post-update audit protocol (protocols/post-update-audit.md)
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with post-update audit trigger
- Built nightly exploration system: INTERESTS.md + EXPLORATIONS.md + JOURNAL.md (restructured, deduped, feedback loop wired)
- Built Exploration 004: Trust Decay (trust networks, betrayal propagation, sound-as-health)
- Rebuilt Explorations 001 + 002 (lost from prior sessions)
- Fixed mobile touch support on all explorations
- Updated nightly cron prompt with USER.md reference + catalog number check

**Security assessment (Johann's guide):**
- Score: 10/13 ✅ | 1 ⚠️ | 1 ❌ | 1 N/A
- Docker sandbox: NOW CONFIGURED ✅
- API key audit: NOW AUTOMATED ✅
- 3 plaintext API keys still in openclaw.json (Google, Venice Brave, Venice sk_) — migration to env vars planned
- 3 bot tokens in plaintext (Telegram, Slack×2) — same migration needed
- File permissions: 600 ✅

**Decisions made:**
- [DECISION] Docker sandbox mode: non-main (main session on host, sub-agents sandboxed)
- [DECISION] Workspace access: rw (sub-agents need to write explorations, daily logs)
- [DECISION] Network: none default (most sub-agents don't need internet)
- [DECISION] modelByChannel skipped — requires specific chat IDs, not worth effort for read-only Slack
- [DECISION] Fallback chain: Opus → Sonnet → GPT-4o

**Open threads:**
- Plaintext API keys migration to env vars (MEDIUM priority, HIGH risk if botched)
- SSH state needs admin-level verification
- Gemini 2.5 Pro + 3.1 Pro both need Google billing enabled
- Tonight's 2 AM nightly cron is first test of restructured exploration system on Kimi
