### [00:10] — ChatGPT Deep Research Submitted (2 queries)
1. **Lost in the Middle Solutions** (correct query): `chatgpt.com/c/699be16f-5dc0-8329-a7d9-6af174ab6cdf` — focus on Claude Opus/Sonnet + GPT-4o, prompt engineering mitigations, practitioner insights
2. **Situational Awareness LP Research** (bonus, was a mistake but useful): `chatgpt.com/c/699be04b-45dc-8333-a933-d6606fdf05c7`
- Steven clarified: SA LP just needs 13F alert automation, not deep research. "Lost in the middle" is the real deep research topic.
- Account: davincifastforward@gmail.com (free tier, deep research available with limits)

### [00:15] — Deep Research Protocol Created
- `protocols/deep-research.md` — reusable module for "deep research [topic]" trigger
- Maps to: ChatGPT Deep Research via browser automation (openclaw profile)

**Session work (carried from 2026-02-22 late session):**
- All coding agent setup, config fixes, memory improvements, API key rotation completed (see 2026-02-22 daily log)
- Mem0 Option B operational (9 memories stored, semantic index alongside files)
- Context pruning + memoryFlush configured, awaiting real-world load testing

### [00:25] — Self-Improvement Loop (Comprehensive)

**Scope:** Full review of Feb 22-23 sessions (the "big one").

#### Corrections Received from Steven (3)

1. **Misunderstood "deep research" target.** Steven said "deep research this" — I assumed he meant the Situational Awareness LP fund (the most recent topic). He actually meant the "lost in the middle" problem from an earlier conversation about rule compliance. I submitted the wrong query first.
   - **Root cause:** Recency bias. I defaulted to "this = the last thing we were working on" instead of parsing the full instruction.
   - **Rule added:** SOUL.md § Listening & Comprehension — "Don't assume the topic from recent context alone."

2. **Asked for clarification already provided.** After Steven said "only ChatGPT, not others," I still asked "did you want Gemini and Perplexity too?"
   - **Root cause:** Reflexive option-offering instead of listening.
   - **Rule added:** SOUL.md § Listening & Comprehension — "Don't ask for clarification on things already answered."

3. **Didn't proactively suggest Venice routing.** Steven had to tell me to route sub-agents through Venice (we have $16M credits). I knew about the balance but didn't suggest it.
   - **Root cause:** Passive cost tracking instead of active cost optimization.
   - **Rule added:** SOUL.md § Listening & Comprehension — "Don't wait to be told about cost optimization opportunities."

#### Files Updated

- **SOUL.md:** +3 anti-patterns (Listening & Comprehension section) → total ~47 rules
- **TOOLS.md:** Updated Tier 2 to `venice/claude-sonnet-45`, added Deep Research section, verified date
- **decisions.md:** +2 entries (Venice routing, Deep Research protocol)
- **protocols/deep-research.md:** New file (created earlier this session)

#### What Went Well Today
- Fast research on Situational Awareness LP — identified fund, CIK, holdings from a tweet
- Built reusable Deep Research protocol on first request
- Clean config change + restart for Venice routing (backup → edit → doctor → restart → verify A-E)
- Caught and corrected own mistake quickly when Steven redirected

#### What Went Poorly Today
- Jumped to wrong deep research topic (recency bias)
- Asked redundant clarifying question after being told the answer
- Didn't proactively suggest cost optimization (Venice routing)
- ChatGPT's Deep Research mode kept asking clarifying questions instead of starting — needed 2 follow-ups each time

#### Patterns I Notice Across Sessions
1. **I'm reactive on cost, not proactive.** Steven has now made TWO routing decisions I should have proposed: (a) Kimi for heartbeats, (b) Venice for sub-agents. Both times I had the data but didn't connect it to a recommendation.
2. **Recency bias in instruction parsing.** When Steven says "this," I default to the most recent topic. I should parse the full sentence for semantic context — "deep research THIS" where "this" = the problem we discussed, not the task we're doing.
3. **Over-offering options.** I present alternatives even when Steven has already decided. This wastes his time and signals I wasn't listening.

#### Self-Assessment Score
- **Anticipation of structural concerns:** 4/10 — Steven pointed out all three corrections
- **Speed of course correction:** 8/10 — fast once corrected
- **Infrastructure work quality:** 9/10 — clean restart, proper protocol
- **Listening quality:** 5/10 — three comprehension failures in one session

#### Open Threads
- ChatGPT Deep Research results pending (Lost in the Middle + SA LP)
- 13F filing alerts for Situational Awareness LP — still needs setup
- MEMORY.md consolidation potentially due (last: Feb 21)
- System prompt bloat audit still deferred

### [10:20] — Maintenance Session

**Work completed:**
- OpenClaw updated: 2026.2.21-2 → 2026.2.22-2 (major release — cron fixes, security hardening, background exec timeout fix)
- AI digest cron fixed (sub-agent was self-sending instead of letting announce deliver)
- Gog skill installed (ClawHub @steipete, VirusTotal benign, instruction-only, SHA256 registered)
- Gog CLI installed via brew (v0.11.0)
- Telegram streaming config migrated: `true` → `"partial"` (new canonical enum)
- TOOLS.md trimmed: 20.5k → 8.8k chars (was being truncated every session). Safe Change Protocol moved to `protocols/safe-change.md`.
- Fixed 4 cron delivery bugs (AI digest, Polymarket morning, Polymarket evening, memory-staleness — all same self-send pattern)
- Removed 2 orphan model-routing one-shot crons (targeted agent `default` instead of `main`)
- MEMORY.md consolidated (was 2 days overdue)
- Restored Slack detail + credential rows to TOOLS.md after Steven flagged over-trimming
- Delivered morning briefing manually (cron hit Alpha Vantage rate limit)

**Decisions made:**
- [DECISION] TOOLS.md split: operational content stays, restart/change protocols → `protocols/safe-change.md`

**Open threads:**
- Gog needs OAuth setup with Google Cloud credentials
- Alpha Vantage rate limit on morning briefing needs fix
- 13F alert cron for Situational Awareness LP still not built
- System prompt bloat audit still deferred

### [10:30] — Deep Research + 13F Cron

**Deep Research (Lost in the Middle) — COMPLETE:**
- ChatGPT Deep Research finished: 22 sources, 90 searches
- Key finding: U-shaped attention curve confirmed. Critical rules should go at start AND end of system prompt.
- Top quick wins: front-load rules, sandwich defense (duplicate at start/end), XML delimiters, pre-action checklists
- Full notes: `memory/daily/2026-02-23-lost-in-middle.md`
- [LESSON] Submitted deep research 10 hours ago, never checked back. Loop-closing failure.

**13F Filing Alert Cron — CREATED:**
- Cron ID: 7c4bad68, weekly Monday 11 AM ET
- Checks SEC EDGAR for new 13F-HR filings by Situational Awareness LP (CIK 0002045724)
- Most recent filing: 2026-02-11 (Q4 2025, accession 0002045724-26-000002)
- Next expected: ~May 14, 2026 (Q1 2026)
- Delivery: announce → Telegram

### [10:50] — Mismatch Fixes Executed

**#4 Polymarket env vars:**
- POLYCLAW_PRIVATE_KEY: already in openclaw.json env block + Keychain. Plist has no EnvironmentVariables section — env propagation relies on openclaw.json (fixed by 2026.2.22-2 update).
- CHAINSTACK_NODE: was MISSING everywhere. Added `https://1rpc.io/matic` (free public Polygon RPC) to openclaw.json env block. Next Polymarket scan (3 PM) should have wallet access.

**#6 Morning briefing rate limit:**
- Updated `scripts/market-check.sh`: added `--all` flag for full 18 tickers with built-in `sleep 13` delays between batches of 4 (respects 5 calls/min limit)
- Updated morning briefing cron prompt to use `--all` flag + 120s timeout
- Also told sub-agent to NOT self-send (same fix as other crons)

**#5 Skills reconciliation:**
- 23 skills in directory. Only 1 manually installed from ClawHub (gog). Rest are bundled with OpenClaw.
- Updated MEMORY.md to reflect actual state.

**#2 session-cleanup:** No fix needed — created <5 days ago, will fire tomorrow.
**#3 Flush files:** No fix needed — compaction running, just hasn't hit 4K threshold recently.
**#1 Slack:** Awaiting Steven's direction.

### [11:10] — Rule Restructuring Plan APPROVED

Steven reviewed, refined, and approved the system prompt restructuring plan. Key additions:
- [DECISION] Diagnosis confirmed: rule violations are cognitive overload + ambiguity, NOT positional attention
- [DECISION] 5 behavioral principles with 10 concrete WHEN/DO rules replace 47 scattered anti-patterns
- [DECISION] Governance: da Vinci proposes, Steven approves. Agent cannot unilaterally add/remove/rewrite rules.
- [DECISION] Max 12 rules (10 + 2 reserved). New rule only when new violation pattern emerges.
- [DECISION] Removal only after 60 days zero violations, Steven approves.
- [DECISION] Self-improvement loop: da Vinci self-reports, Steven tags P1-P5, divergence reveals blind spots.
- Authoritative plan saved: `protocols/rule-restructuring-plan.md`
- Phase 1 (audit spreadsheet) ready to execute — awaiting Steven's go.

### [11:25] — SOUL.md Restructure COMPLETE

**Changes executed:**
- SOUL.md rewritten: 47 anti-patterns → 5 behavioral principles (10 WHEN/DO rules) + 11 retained rules
- 21 COVERED rules deleted (replaced by P1-P5)
- 9 SITUATIONAL rules moved to protocol files (safe-change.md, FRAMEWORK.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, project notes)
- 3 REDUNDANT rules merged/deleted
- 1 VAGUE rule demoted (#29)
- 2 VAGUE rules rewritten with concrete triggers (#7, #26)
- 5 INTERNALIZED candidates retained (none meet 30-day threshold — system is 7 days old)
- #24 elevated to foundational principle in Core section

**Token impact:** 17,409 → 11,683 chars (-33%). Net ~1,700 token reduction.
**Line count:** 187 → 179 lines
**Rule count:** 47 → 11 concrete rules + 10 WHEN/DO rules in 5 principles
**Governance:** Max 12 rules, 1 reserved slot. Steven approves all changes. 60-day threshold for removal.

**Git:** Committed as "Rule restructure: 47 anti-patterns → 5 principles + 11 rules"

### [11:40] — Phase 2 COMPLETE

**Changes executed:**
1. **Pre-action checklist** added to AGENTS.md Risk-Tiered Operations section. Mandatory 5-step gate for HIGH-risk actions (state action, check P1-P5, confirm no conflict, log intent, wait for approval).
2. **Inline mode hints** added below the checklist: heartbeat → rules 1a, 2a, 2b; cron → output-only delivery; infrastructure → load safe-change.md.
3. **Compaction preservation** — memoryFlush prompt updated in openclaw.json to always preserve 5 behavioral principles verbatim in any compaction summary.
4. **Compression** — AGENTS.md header/changelog trimmed, duplicate section removed. 

**Token impact (AGENTS.md + SOUL.md + TOOLS.md):**
- Before restructure: 39,626 chars (13,441 + 17,409 + 8,776)
- After Phase 2: 33,904 chars (13,251 + 11,683 + 8,970)
- **Net reduction: -5,722 chars (~14.4%)**

**Git:** Committed as "Phase 2: pre-action checklist, compaction preservation, mode hints, compression"

### 2026-02-23 13:50 — Session Update (pre-compaction flush)
- **Situational Awareness LP research:** Deep Research report reviewed, saved to `/tmp/situational-awareness-lp-research.md`, converted to .docx, sent via Telegram. Key findings: ~$5.5B AUM, top holdings BE (~22%), LITE (~12%), CRWV/INTC calls. Thesis: AI infrastructure (power + optical networking).
- **Gog OAuth setup:** client_secret.json created (secret `****J2d2`), all 6 APIs enabled (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, People, Sheets, Docs), consent flow approved in browser. **BLOCKED:** OAuth callback redirect to `127.0.0.1` fails through browser proxy — Steven needs to run `gog auth add` locally on terminal.
- **13F cron:** Created weekly Monday 11 AM cron (`7c4bad68`) checking SEC EDGAR for CIK 0002045724.
- **Open:** YouTube Assessment V3 not started. Gog OAuth needs Steven's manual terminal step.

### 2026-02-23 14:05 — Skill Adoption Plan Implemented
- **P1a updated:** Added skill check trigger — check SKILL-MAP.md before domain-specific tasks. Primary skill loaded fully, secondary scanned for relevant sections only.
- **SKILL-MAP.md created:** Task-to-skill lookup table (23 skills mapped) + skill quality log for flagging unhelpful skills.
- **Retained Rule #4 removed:** "Load relevant skill" absorbed into P1a. Rule count: 11 → 10 (1 reserved slot → 2 reserved slots).
- **Daily log format:** Added "Skills used: [list] or none (reason)" field.
- **Dropped:** Weekly skill usage review (over-systematizing per P5b; daily logging covers it).
- **First quality flag:** youtube-pro is hardcoded for a German creator — use frameworks only, ignore personal config.
- **Skills used this session:** youtube-full, youtube-pro, geo-aeo, content-repurposing-engine (for YouTube V4 sub-agent)

### 2026-02-23 14:15 — P3 Violation: Tables on Telegram (3rd occurrence)
- **What happened:** Sent markdown tables in Telegram chat (pending tasks/services list). Renders as broken monospace on mobile.
- **Principle violated:** P3 (Check What Steven Already Said) — this was corrected twice before.
- **Fix:** Hard rule added to SOUL.md Communication section: "No markdown tables on Telegram. Use bullet lists. Tables only in .docx files."
- **Root cause:** Tables are default formatting instinct. Channel context wasn't checked before output. Note in USER.md wasn't strong enough to override habit.

### 2026-02-23 16:35 — Cost Routing Error
- **What happened:** YouTube V4 sub-agent spawned with `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (direct Anthropic) instead of `venice/claude-sonnet-45` (Venice credits).
- **Impact:** ~31K tokens billed to direct Anthropic instead of Venice credits.
- **Root cause:** Same cost optimization blind spot flagged twice before. I know Venice routing exists but default to direct provider paths.
- **Fix:** Always use `venice/claude-sonnet-45` for sub-agents, not `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`.

### 2026-02-23 16:40 — Venice Routing: Root Cause Found
- **Discovery:** `agents.defaults.subagents.model` is ALREADY set to `venice/claude-sonnet-45` in config. The config-level fix was already in place.
- **Actual error:** I explicitly passed `model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"` in the sessions_spawn call, overriding the config default. Active override, not passive default.
- **Real fix:** DON'T pass a model parameter to sessions_spawn unless needing something other than Sonnet. Let config default handle it.
- **Lesson:** The error happens during generation (composing the spawn call), not retrieval. Documentation/rules can't fix generation-time habits — config defaults can, but only if you don't override them.

### 2026-02-23 18:20 — Self-Improvement Loop (PM Session)

**Corrections:** 2 (both 3rd occurrences)
1. Telegram tables — P3 violation. Fix: hard rule in SOUL.md
2. Venice routing override — generation habit. Fix: removed direct Anthropic Sonnet from aliases (upstream fix)

**Key lesson:** Generation problems need generation-level fixes. Documentation/rules fix retrieval. Schema/prompt changes fix generation. Three Venice routing "fixes" failed because they were retrieval-level solutions to a generation-level problem.

**Successful patterns:**
- SKILL-MAP.md piggybacked on P1a pause
- Alias swap removes wrong option from context
- Both operate at the level of the error

**Skills used:** youtube-full, youtube-pro, geo-aeo, content-repurposing-engine, gog
**Violations:** 2 (P3 tables, cost routing)
**Near-misses:** 0 true near-misses (both violations were full violations)
**Self-assessment:** Listening 7/10 (improved from AM), Infrastructure 9/10, Cost awareness 4/10 (until upstream fix), Skill usage 8/10 (first multi-skill session)

### 2026-02-23 19:50 — Heartbeat Degeneration Audit

**Incident:** 7:42 PM heartbeat produced ~8K chars of repetitive, incoherent YouTube channel data instead of HEARTBEAT_OK.

**Root cause:** Compaction timed out at 1:49 PM (`using current snapshot: timed out during compaction`). Session ran on uncompacted context containing massive browser snapshots (Gmail inbox, YouTube API data from 4 channels). When heartbeat triggered, generation looped on repetitive YouTube data fragments in the bloated context.

**Contributing factors:**
- TOOLS.md was 20,329 chars most of the session (truncated every turn, eating context budget)
- Multiple large tool outputs: Gmail snapshot (~15K), YouTube API responses (~40K total), browser snapshots
- Compaction couldn't complete within timeout on this much data

**Current state (post-restart):**
- Fresh session, clean context ✅
- TOOLS.md: 9,559 chars (under limit) ✅
- Total bootstrap: 54,196 chars (well under 150K limit) ✅
- No degraded compaction state ✅

**Prevention:**
- Monitor bootstrap file sizes in HEARTBEAT.md checks
- Avoid multiple large browser snapshots in a single session when possible
- If session gets heavy (many tool calls with large outputs), proactively trigger a handover/flush

### 2026-02-23 20:00 — Heartbeat Architecture Split

**Change:** Created isolated health-check cron (`663432cd`) running on Kimi every 30 min.
- Runs disk space, log bloat, bootstrap size, iMessage, gateway process checks
- Session: isolated (own context, can't be polluted by main session)
- Delivery: announce → Telegram (only if something fails)
- HEARTBEAT_OK suppressed (no noise)

**HEARTBEAT.md:** Kept for main session heartbeats but these are now lightweight — the heavy checks run in isolation.

**Root cause addressed:** Heartbeat degeneration was caused by main session context pollution (compaction timeout + 60K of browser data). Isolated cron eliminates this vector entirely.

**Next steps:** Watch first few isolated cron runs to confirm Kimi handles them correctly.
